Deep Mob Learning: Refabricated is a parallel version of Deep Mob Learning Minecraft Mod (originally authored by [xt9](https://github.com/xt9/DeepMobLearning)) made to Fabric Mod Loader.

The main theme of this mod (by "this" I mean the version you can find in this repository) is providing cool ways to acquire mob loot. I also have a lot of other plans to implement here and give the mod other purposes too, but since the current stage of the mod is beta thats all I have to offer for now :/

## Xt9's Version
This project is a rework of the original Deep Mob Learning mod, authored by [xt9](https://github.com/xt9/DeepMobLearning).

His version of the mod is focused in providing a better way to acquire mob loot in servers, because creating big mobtraps and things like that doesn't always works well or can have huge performance impacts. If you don't know his version, you should definitively check it out first, he is a pretty cool guy and does a lot of nice things in the Minecraft community.

## Can I add it to a modpack?
Absolutely! You can download the mod on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deep-mob-learning-refabricated), just pick the latest release for your game version, make sure you installed the dependencies too.

## Will there ever be a Forge version?
**Well yes but actually no.** If you want a Forge version of this mod you should check out the [xt9's version](#xt9s-version)

About Deep Mob Learning: **Refabricated**, unfortunately I don't plan to support Forge by myself. But if you want to, take some words with [Cafeteria](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf) and [the original author of the mod](#xt9s-version) and you should be fine.

## Setting up dev env
The only special thing that differs from a gradle project is that you will need to have this section in your ``~/.gradle/gradle.properties`` file:

```
mcdUsername=foo
mcdPassword=bar
curseforgeToken=foobar
```

The values can be dummy, fill with the right ones if you somehow need to do the publications.
